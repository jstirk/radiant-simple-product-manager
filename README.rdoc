= Simple Product Manager

A RadiantCMS extension providing a mechanism to handle products and
categories that can then be used across the rest of the RadiantCMS site.

Also provides Category and Product pages for each of the items listed,
and these pages can be prepared using existing Layouts and Snippets.

It was once very simple, now it does a little bit more...
